# SeedScribe
SeedScribe is garden journal app. View all garden journals created by yourself and others, but only you have access
to edit your own 'garden.' By creating an account, you can create a garden, add plants to it, and add notes to each plant.
Over time your journal will teach you a lot about the gardening process. From seed germination, garden building, planting,
pruning, to harvesting, keep track of everything! If you're curious, look at others' gardens and see what they're planting and how they're doing it.
